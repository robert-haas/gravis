    "A graph of integers and their divisibility relation can be created from following basic ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each integer (up to some maximum) is represented by a node.\n",
    "- If an integer is divisible (without remainder) by another integer, an edge is drawn from the smaller to the larger integer to represent their divisibility relation. Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, hence they have zero incoming edges if these trivial cases are excluded, i.e. using integers from 2 upwards and not testing if an integer can be divided by itself.\n",
    "- Different integers have quite different numbers of divisors. The number of divisors for a certain integer can be represented by node size (=more incoming edges means more divisors, shown by a larger node size) and additionally by node colors (a certain number of incoming edges is shown by a certain color)."
