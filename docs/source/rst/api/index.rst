API documentation
=================

.. note::
   This software adheres to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_.
   The current release is a **beta version**, hence the **API is not entirely fixed yet**.
   This means that with the deployment of new releases you should expect
   minor changes to existing features including additions and deletions.
   Once version 1.0.0 is reached the public API will be fixed.

This
`API documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_
gives detailed information on all public functions provided by this package to its
users. It is semi-automatically generated from source code and
`docstrings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring#Python>`_
with the popular tool
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_
and its
`autodoc <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_
and
`napoleon <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html>`_
extensions. The same information can be obtained as help page with
`Python's built-in help system <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help>`_
but only in plain text instead of nicely formatted HTML documents.
